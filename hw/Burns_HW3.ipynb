    "**We're going to briefly look at truth tables. As an example let's assume we have a 100 photos, some of birds and some of people. In a truth table you assume you can categorize the true answerâ€”let's say you pay an undergraduate to sort the photos into birds and people. Then you want to have an automated sorting algorithm. However that works, whether it is by looking a the color at the center of photo or using a neural network (NN), it will also sort the photos but imperfectly. Given two sorts you can then arrange a truth table:**\n",

    "**This is useful because it not only shows the number of errors, but the type, and not all errors are created equal. Let's say our identification system is being used to keep birds from escaping the aviary at the zoo by locking the aviary door when a bird is trying to escape. We really don't want to let birds escape, but locking a person in for 30 extra seconds is not a big deal. In this case false bird identification is not so bad, but false person identification lets a bird escape.**\n",

As the question states, if the algorithm mistakes a person for a bird, that is no big deal because it will lock the door on the person, but the door can be easily unlocked and the person can leave. However, if the algorithm mistakes a bird for a person, the bird will be able to escape, and it will not be easy to get the bird back into the aviary. <br/>\n",
