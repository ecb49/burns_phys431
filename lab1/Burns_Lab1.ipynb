    "Converting a probability into a 'sigma'. As discussed in class, 'sigma' refers to a probability in physics. Our first task is to figure out how, given a probability, to calculate the assoicated 'sigma' value. The sigma implicitly refers to the standard normal distribution (a Gaussian with mean zero and stard deviation of 1). As we discussed in class, integrals of the standard normal distribution give probabilities.\n",

    "A. Look up the Normal distribution and read about it. A few potential starting points: Math is fun, Wolfram, and a useful z table\n",
    "\n",
    "B. As in class, try integrating the standard normal distribution. This can be done either with the erfc(), or calls to specific statistical cumulative probability distributions such as normcdf() in MatLab or stats.norm.cdf() in scipy. Try several values of sigma, and make sure you are getting values that match the z-table.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Now more often than not, we actually want to do the inverse: for a given probability determine the associated 'sigma' value: norminv() or erfcinv() in MatLab; stats.norm.ppf() in python. Try several probability values where you know what the answer should be (e.g. Probability associated with 1, 2, 5 sigma), and show that you get the right answer in terms of sigma.\n",
